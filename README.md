# Welcome to the respository that is associated with Chase et al. 2020

Here you will find the data used for training and testing of the neural network, along with the script actually used in training the neural network. This is provided so that the results of the manuscript are reproducable. 

The data for the analysis on the observations are not provided here because of the size of the radar data. Please see the GHRC website if you wish to download the radar and in-situ data.
